Autonomous 4-wheel robotic system capable of real-time obstacle detection and navigation using ultrasonic sensing and servo-based environmental scanning.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a real-time autonomous control system based on a perception–decision–action pipeline:

**Sensor Input → Environment Mapping → Decision Logic → Motor Control**

The robot dynamically scans its surroundings and adjusts movement to avoid obstacles without human intervention.

## 🧠 System Architecture

![Circuit Diagram](docs/obsticale_avoidance_circuit_diagram.png)

### Core Pipeline
- **Perception** → Ultrasonic sensor + servo scanning
- **Processing** → Distance computation + comparison
- **Decision** → Rule-based navigation logic
- **Action** → Motor control via L298N driver
